# RuleMaker
Based off of the chapter in Daniel Kahneman's <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i> called "Intuitions Vs. Formulas", RuleMaker helps individuals form rules to guide their intuitions to make consistent and more accurate decisions.<br></br> 
While formulas are not magical or 100% accurate, they can often perform as well or better than human intution.<br></br> 
The app creates an intuitive (of course) interface and framework with which to create rules as a simple question/answer response and as an "object" manager for attempting to change or optimize those rules.<br></br> 
For now, this is just an Android app.

#Note
This is still a work in progress, and development is intermittent at best. Expect an incomplete project with plenty of bugs.
