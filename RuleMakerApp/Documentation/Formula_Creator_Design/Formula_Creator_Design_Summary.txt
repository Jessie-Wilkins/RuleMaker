The Formula Creator creates a rule or formula based on the user's input whether that is via direct input or through
a questionnaire. The following is the specific or granular use cases or user story for this class or concept.

Scenario 1: The user chooses to directly input the formula components.
    1. The user enters the number of values.
    2. The user enters in a variable name and value type.
    3. The user enters in an operator (*, +, -, /, etc.).
    4. The user does this until the formula template has been populated.
    5. The user can choose to add another blank variable and operator to the formula.
    6. The user confirms and saves the formula.
Scenario 2: The user chooses to use a questionnaire to create the formula.
    1. The user is asked about what kind of problem or scenario they are dealing with.
    2. The user is then asked about what potentially contributes or affects the problem or scenario.
    3. The user is then asked what kind of factor it is (number, status, yes/no value, etc.).
    4. After this, the user is asked what other factors exist that affect the outcome of a scenario.
    5. After adding this second factor, the user is asked how the first and second factor affect each other
    (factor2 negates factor1, factor2 adds to factor1, etc.)
    6. The user will then continue the questionnaire which asks the same series of questions.
    7. If the user is done adding different factors of the scenario, they say 'no' to the question about adding
    a factor.
    8. The application finishes the questionnaire and creates the application.
