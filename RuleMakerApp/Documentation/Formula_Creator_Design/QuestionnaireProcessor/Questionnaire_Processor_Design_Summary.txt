The Quesionnaire Processor is a subsystem within the Formula Creator system that helps process the answers
from the given questions and can create new processing algorithms for each question and its answer type.
Due to the complexity of this kind of system, a whole new design must be implemented for this.

Question Processor:
    The Question Processor will both choose the algorithm to be used (based on what question it is) and will process
    the result from the answer given.
    The algorithms will be limited to the FormulaCreator class methods and components, but the decision of
    which method or component to use based on the answer can be done via process flows.
    For example, if the user gives an answer to the question "What is the relationship between this variable 
    and the last variable", the user's answer of "additive" or "duplicative" can be used 
    to select "addition" or "multiplication" respectively.
    For choosing the algorithm, it will most likely use some indexing system.
    For processing the algorithm, it will use some flexible methods to implement the algorithms
    based on what was set beforehand and based on the user input.
Question Algorithm Maker:
    The Question Algorithm Maker will be tasked with forming the algorithms for each question.
    The questions that were created beforehand will be mapped to algorithms, and the algorithms will be
    created by choosing pre-created "flows".
    Flows in this case determine what FormulaCreator components and methods should be used for the given question.
    The flows will be high-level "if" statements that can be activated based on the user answers.
    A typical flow will look something like this (at a high-level):
        if additive -> add plus sign.
    The creation of flows will probably look similar to how Formulas are created: they are iterative and can be
    created to any maximum depth (in this case, with if statements and actions).
