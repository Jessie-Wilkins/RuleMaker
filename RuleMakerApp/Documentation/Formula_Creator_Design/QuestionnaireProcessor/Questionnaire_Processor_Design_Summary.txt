The Quesionnaire Processor is a subsystem within the Formula Creator system that helps process the answers
from the given questions and can create new processing algorithms for each question and its answer type.
Due to the complexity of this kind of system, a whole new design must be implemented for this.

Question Processor:
    The Question Processor will both choose the algorithm to be used (based on what question it is) and will process
    the result from the answer given.
    The algorithms will be limited to the FormulaCreator class methods and components, but the decision of
    which method or component to use based on the answer can be done via process flows.
    For example, if the user gives an answer to the question "What is the relationship between this variable 
    and the last variable", the user's answer of "additive" or "duplicative" can be used 
    to select "addition" or "multiplication" respectively.
